# code coverage tool
 `gcov` is a source code coverage analysis and statement-by-statement profiling tool. 
 ### codeCoverageTest.c
 ```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "codeCoverageTest.h"

int fn1()
{
	int a =5;
	a++;
	return (a);
}

int fn2(int b)
{
	if (b>10)
	{
		fn1();
		return(b);
	}
	else
		return(0);
}
 ```
 ###codeCoverageTest.h
 ```
#include <stdio.h>
int fn1(void);
int fn2(int);
 ```
 ### main.c
 ```
 #include <stdio.h>
#include "codeCoverageTest.h"
int main ()
{
	fn1();
	fn2(5);
}
 ```
### Steps to get code coverage details 
- compile the source with `--coverage` flag it will generate main.gcno and codeCoverageTest.gcno files
```
$ gcc --coverage main.c codeCoverageTest.c -o codeCoverageTest 
```
- Run the executable file 
```
$ ./codeCoverageTest
```
- After completed running executable file it will generate  main.gcda and codeCoverageTest.gcda files
- Run the code coverage command 
```
$ gcov -abcfu codeCoverageTest.c
```
**output:**
>Function 'fn2'

Creating 'codeCoverageTest.c.gcov'
- Detailed coverage report will be available in the codeCoverageTest.c.gcov file generated by gcov
